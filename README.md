# DeepRL_Project1

An RL agent trained to play Banana Game using 3 different algorithms.
1. DQN
2. DDQN
3. Duelling DQN

The saved model weights are respectively:
1. checkpoint.pth
2. checkpoint_ddqn.pth
3. checkpoint_dueldqn.pth

To train the agent using different algorithms, you just need to import the various agents.py files respectively
1. my_agent.py
2. myagent_ddqn.py
3. myagent_dueldqn.py

Replace "import my_agent as mag" with the suitable agent required.

The hyperparameters and results have been separately written in the Report.md file and a video of the agent doing the task has also also been provided in the repo as "banana2.mp4".
